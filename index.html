  <h2 class="topic"><u>Glycol Units</u></h2>
  <p class="about">A glycol unit is an important piece of equipment in the brewing industry for maintaining beer temperature, especially in
  fermentation and conditioning processes.
</p>

<div class="folder">
  <div class="file file1">
    <strong>Consistent Conditioning Temperatures:</strong>
<br><br>
After fermentation, beer often undergoes conditioning or maturation, where it matures and flavors develop. Keeping a consistent and controlled temperature during this phase is essential for achieving the desired taste and clarity. Glycol units are used to cool or heat conditioning tanks as needed.
  </div>
  <div class="file file2">
    <strong>Efficient Heat Exchange:</strong>
    <br><br>
    Glycol has excellent heat transfer properties, allowing for efficient temperature control. The glycol unit acts as a
    heat exchanger, absorbing heat from the beer or fermentation vessels and transferring it to a refrigeration system.
  </div>
  <div class="file file3">
    <strong>Flexibility in Temperature Ranges:</strong>
    <br><br>
    Glycol units offer brewers the flexibility to control temperatures within a wide range. This is important as different
    beer styles may require specific temperature profiles for fermentation and conditioning.
  </div>
  <div class="file file4">
    <strong>Preventing Overheating or Cooling:</strong>
    <br><br>
    In large-scale breweries or those located in regions with varying climate conditions, the ambient temperature can
    fluctuate. Glycol units help prevent overheating or overcooling of beer by adjusting the glycol temperature accordingly.
  </div>
  <div class="file file5">
   <strong>Maintaining Quality and Consistency:</strong>
    <br><br>
    Consistency is key in brewing to produce high-quality beer with consistent taste characteristics. Glycol units
    contribute to this by providing precise temperature control, ensuring each batch is brewed under the same conditions.

  <h2 class="topic"><u>Working on Glycol Units :</u></h2>
  <div class="folder">
    <ul class="key">
      <li class="list1">
        When working on the Glycol unit, unplug the unit from the outlet
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ALWAYS</strong> want the glycol unit to maintain temperatures between 28 - 33 degrees fahrenheit
      </li>
    </ul>


    <div class="file file1">
      <strong>Check temperatures </strong>
      <br><br>
      To retrieve temperatures, use a refractometer (this key tool checks the glycol FP or freeze point) and a regular thermoter.
      <br><br>
      A refractometer helps check if your glycol unit has the right amount of glycol. To measure, take a sample of the
      glycol-water mix from the unit and put it on the refractometer's slab.
      <br><br>
      Maintain the glycol-water mix between -10 and +5 (numbers on the inside to the right). If it reads +10 or higher, drain some
      mix and add pure glycol. If it goes below -10, drain the unit to get it to the right measurement. ALL measurements of how much to drain or to add determines what the measurement shows when retrieving the intial temperature.
      <br><br>
      To retrieve the temperature of coldness of what the unit is producing, dip thermometer into the glycol-water mix.

      <strong>Working on the pump and motor</strong>
      <br><br>
      If the pump or motor isn't working properly, it's better to replace the one that's causing the issue. You might not have to replace both; sometimes, it's just the pump or just the motor.
      <br><br>
      Step One :
      <br>
      Disconnect the pump from the motor. In order to do that, take off the clamp that is connecting both parts together. Once the clamp has been removed, then pull apart the clamp and motor and start working on removing the motor from the glycol unit completely.
      <br><br>
      Step two :
      <br>
      To take out the motor entirely, unfasten the clamps found at both ends of the motor, which connect it to the bracket.
